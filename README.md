# Weird Posterior
A collection of real world models that give posterior with interesting shapes. The model, citations and impelmentation in Stan (and R). 

## The collections
- Banana shaped
  - N-mixture models [code](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/banana/N-mixture), [readme](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/blob/master/banana/N-mixture/n-mixture.md)

- Cross shaped
  - Gaussian mixture prior [code](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/cross/spike-and-slab), [readme](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/blob/master/cross/spike-and-slab/spike-and-slab.md)
