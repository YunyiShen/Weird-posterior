# Weird Posteriors
A collection of real world models that give posterior with interesting shapes. The model, citations and impelmentation in Stan (and R). 

## The collections
- Banana shaped
  - N-mixture models [code](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/banana/N-mixture), [readme](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/blob/master/banana/N-mixture/n-mixture.md)

- Cross shaped
  - Gaussian mixture prior [code](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/cross/spike-and-slab), [readme](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/blob/master/cross/spike-and-slab/spike-and-slab.md)
  
- Tunnel shaped
  - Badly co-linear design [code](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/tunnel/linear-regression), [readme](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/tunnel/linear-regression/lm_wrong.md)
  - Plackett-Luce ranking model [code](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/tunnel/Plackett-Luce), [readme](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/tree/master/tunnel/Plackett-Luce/Plackett-Luce.md)

- Multi-modal
  - Adaptive Bayesian LASSO [code](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/master/multi-modal/variable-selection), [readme](https://github.com/YunyiShen/weird-posteriors/master/multi-modal/variable-selection/bad-lasso.md)
